# PortScanner
An advanced port scanner | By Yonatan Cohen
- Port Scanner is an application designed to probe a server or host for open ports. Such an application may be used by administrators to verify security policies of their networks and by attackers to identify network services running on a host and exploit vulnerabilities.
 - I wrote this code (in Python) in order to use it for my own uses in cyber security.
